Reflection works at `run time`, without knowing variable types at compile time.
- update variables and inspect their values at run time
- call their methods
- apply the operations intrinsic to their representation

Reflection is used in:
- string formatting of fmt
- protocol encoding in `encoding/json` and `encoding/xml`
- template mechanism `text/template`, `html/template`

Reflection increases expressiveness of language but complex and are not exposed in the packages's API
